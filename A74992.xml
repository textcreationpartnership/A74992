            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> I do my worthy good friend the Author of the Queries. But conſidering that Chriſt must be followed, owned, and pleaded for; in every Doctrine, diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and command of his, when Providence puts men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, though in ſo doing they are many times forced to break Company, as to ſome ways, with dearest Relations, and perſons of their greatest reſpects: and conſidering alſo, that my ſelf as probably occaſioning the birth of the Queries, have a greater engagement upon me then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to anticipate as much as in me lyes, the diſ-ſervice they may do to the truth of Christ; I have therefore the rather thought of returning ſome Anſwer to them. In which Anſwer, my reſpects to the Querist have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to decline all things that might bear hard upon him, ſo far as my faithfulneſs to the truth, would well bear at my hands.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118571:3"/>
            <p>There is almost no end of Diſputes, and it is not to be imagined what the wit of man can do, towards the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things which are not, to ſeem as if they were, and things which are, to appear as if they were not: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it, as it ſhould ſeem, that <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>jealous with a Godly jealouſie over the Corinthians, leſt the ſubtilty of men ſhould carry off their minds from the plainneſs of the Goſpel, 2 Cor. 11.3.</hi> For however there are deep things of God, that are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every eye; yet doubtleſs for things that concern even the meanest Babe in Christ, to beleeve and practiſe in order to his being numbred with the Saints, ſuch as are the beginning Doctrines of Christ, as <hi>Repentance from dead Works, faith towards God, the Doctrin of Baptiſms,</hi> and the like; God hath not been ſo ſparing of his minde hereabout, as that men must make a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the one end of the Scriptures to the other, and lay both ends together, before they can diſcover the mind of God, as a ground of their faith and practiſe, as ſome would bear us in hand, even in the buſineſs of Baptiſm it ſelf; as if Chriſt had made one of the first things a Chriſtian ſhould do, one of the hardest for him to know, whether he ſhould do it ſo or ſo: but as concerning the principles of the Goſpel, which every Christian muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and ſubmit to, <hi>What ſaith the Scripture? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is the Word of Faith which wee Preach, Rom. 10.8.</hi> Which words (I pray you note) are ſpoken by the Apoſtle in oppoſition to them, who held That the Goſpel was not a perfect Rule to a Chriſtian without the Law; as they alſo do in effect who think the
<pb facs="tcp:118571:3"/> Goſpel Rule for Baptizing Beleevers, is not a perfect Rule to us, but that we muſt be beholding to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Circumciſing Infants, to direct us about the Baptizing of children: as if we ſhould ask the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the evening, whether it were light at noon day.</p>
            <p>Therefore Reader, let me perſwade thee whoſoever thou art, not to ſpend thy precious time and thoughts in following the Wilde-gooſe-chaſe of men, in their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous diſputes about theſe things of common obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practiſe; but beleeve, and act, according to what thou findeſt plainly written in the New Teſtament of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath not left his laſt Wil and Teſtament behinde him in any ſuch dubious Words, as might occaſion his children to fall out about it, but that an evil ſpirit many ages ago got into the Churches, (of which many good men, perhaps ſcarce any, are totally diſpoſeſſed unto this day) which for ſome carnal reſpect, turned them aſide from the plain way of the Goſpel, into wayes and practiſes of their own chuſing; which that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they might make good and juſtifie, they, and thoſe that tread in their ſteps, have ſtrained their wits to finde out Arguments and Plea's, that have ſo darkned and obſcured things that otherwiſe of themſelves were lightſome and plain, that it now proves a hard matter for many, to diſcern what is of Chriſt, and what is but of man.</p>
            <p>And this if thou doeſt, thou ſhalt not need to burden thy ſelf with far fetcht Arguments, to prove that to be lawful, which thou doeſt not finde plainly written as many do; for thou wilt not need to Queſtion at all,
<pb facs="tcp:118571:4"/> whether that way is lawful or no which thou findeſt beaten by the feet of the Saints of old, with the high approbation of heaven: and why ſhould any man go about, when a nearer way preſents it ſelf to him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the begining: if that which ye have heard from the begining remain in you, ye alſo ſhal continue in the Son, and in the Father. 1</hi> John <hi>2.24.</hi>

               <p>Whether is there any Precept or example in the Goſpel of any Baptized Perſon, his diſclaiming of Communion in Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, with thoſe whom he Judges true Beleevers upon account onely of their not having been Baptized?</p>
               <div type="response">
                  <head>Reſpondant.</head>
                  <p>As for matter of Example for ſuch a practiſe, there is I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none in Scripture, no more then there is of diſclaiming communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as now it is, or with the the Parochial Churches in <hi>England</hi> or elſewhere; and yet it wil not follow, that the one is any more unlawful then the other. For Scripture examples are matters of Fact, and therefore, there having been no ſuch corrupt practiſe crept into the world, till after all the books of the holy Scriptures were finiſhed, as is the conſtituting of Churches without Baptiſm, or upon Infant ſprinkling in ſtead of Baptiſm, which in true conſtruction is not onely no Baptiſm at all, but even worſe then none, as much as to commit an evil action is worſe then to omit a good one; there being, I ſay, no ſuch corruption as this then on foot, no more then there was the now Romiſh, the National, or Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Church-conſtitution then in being, there could be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any truely Baptized perſon, to diſclaim communion, either with the one or with the other; and conſequently no ſuch matter of Fact to be Recorded, of which to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>But then it no more follows, that it is unlawful to refuſe communion with the one Church, then it is with the other, if there be no more ground in Scripture to conſtitute Churches without Baptiſm, then there is for the Romiſh, National, and Parochial conſtitution. The Queriſt then having himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Churches in <hi>England,</hi> though he have no example in ſcripture ſo to do, and yet hath done it, becauſe there is no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Scripture for ſuch Church-conſtitution as that of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> is, he might as well diſclaim communion with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118571:6"/> Churches built upon Infant Baptiſm too, ſince there is no more example in Scripture of ſuch a Church conſtitution, then there is of the conſtitution of thoſe Churches, with whom he hath diſclaimed communion; eſpecially conſidering, that there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in abundance in Scripture of Churches of a better conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and that is of Saints Baptized after they had Beleeved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to matter of Precept; though there be no litteral or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labical Precept for Baptized perſons to diſclaim communion in Church-fellowſhip with unbaptized ones, no more then there is for diſclaiming communion with the falſ Churches before mentioned; yet if the Queriſt will ſay, that there is Precept in Scripture, which does virtually require him to diſclaim com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Parochiall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their way, then <hi>I</hi> will ſay the ſame concerning Baptized Beleevers, their refuſing communion with unbaptized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If</hi> it be demanded, what precept doth virtually require ſuch a thing as non-communion of Baptized with unbaptized?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> 1. For thoſe that plead the Precept of circumciſing Infants under the Law, as virtually requiring the baptizing of Infants under the Goſpel, me thinks this ſhould be ſatisfactory as to them, and ſo to the Queriſt himſelf, as touching the Caſe in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> where God requires Circumciſion under pain of being excluded communion with the Church, ſaying, <hi>the uncircumciſed man-child, whoſe fleſh of his fore-skin is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhal be cut off from his people, Gen.</hi> 17.14. for what leſs can be meant by that expreſſion, <hi>ſhal be cut off from his people,</hi> then that ſuch an one ſhould be deprived communion with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Church-fellowſhip? If it be ſaid a cuting off by death, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intended, then <hi>I</hi> ſay, that is excluſive of Church-communion likewiſe; for the Major includes the Minor, and it is more to be cut off by the hand of death, from all oppertunity of future communion with the Church, then it is for a man to be debarred preſent communion, onely in order to his repentance, that he might be regularly capable of communion afterwards.</p>
                  <p>But whether ſuch a cuting off be in that place intended or no moſt certain it is, that ſuch a cuting off is enjoyned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. where its ſaid, ſpeaking of the Paſſover, <hi>That no uncircumciſed perſon ſhal eat thereof.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſion by the command of God, did deprive perſons of communion with the people of God in Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, then, ſo non-Baptiſm does debar perſons of Church-communion now. And now which of the hornes of this dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, will the Pedobaptiſts ſuffer themſelves to be gored by? Will they ſay the conſequence is not good, to argue the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of unbaptized perſons from Church-communion, from the excluſion of uncircumciſed perſons from acts of Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, while circumciſion was in force; if ſo, then how can the conſequence be good, to argue the Baptiſm of Infants from the circumciſion of Infants; for the ſame things have the ſame conſequences; and to things alike, belongs the like reaſon and judgement, and therefore let them either grant my inference, or for ever ceaſe any more to infer from Infants circumciſion, to Infants Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>I</hi> would argue further thus: the ſame Law which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes the learned Queriſt, and others of his way, to deny the priviledge of their Churches to other Beleevers that are not of their Churches, but do ſcruple their way, and cannot ſubmit to their order, the ſame Law does enjoyn baptized beleevers, not to admit into fellowſhip with them in Church priviledges ſuch perſons, though beleevers, as do ſcruple their order and way of being baptized in order to Church communion, and will not ſubmit thereto. For the Scripture is every whit as expreſs for Baptiſm to precede the enjoyment of Church priviledges, as it is for a voluntary conſenting to Church order and government, to precede the ſame enjoyment. Nay <hi>I</hi> am confident, that the Arguments and Plea's, brought to prove it lawful to admit Beleevers to ſuch communion without Baptiſm, if admited as good, would overthrow and level the Order and Diſcipline of particular Churches. For if one ſingle perſon may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Church-priviledges without Baptiſm, or without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting to the order and rule of the Church, both which are previous to acts of Church-communion, and I affirm the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118571:7"/> caſe is more clear for Baptiſm in this behalf in Scripture, then it is for that ſubmiſſion and conſent I ſpeak of; I ſay, if one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be admitted upon ſuch terms, then why not two? if two, why not ten, and ſo a hundred, or a thouſand? and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuch Goſpel order laid totally aſide?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If theſe things ſerve not turn, yet thoſe precepts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, or doctrines, by which men ſtand enjoyned to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Goſpel Order (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17.) do virtually prohibit men Baptized, communion with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized in Church fellowſhip, as that which is contrary thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this was the order of the Goſpel, yea and an order enjoyned by Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that Beleevers ſhould firſt be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, before admited into Church-fellowſhip, will ſufficiently appear, if duly conſidered, from that Commiſſion of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore teach all Nations Baptizing them.</hi> Where we ſee, that the very next thing they were to do, after they had taught men (<hi>viz.</hi> ſo, as to make them willing to obey the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.) was to Baptize them: which injunction therefore, as ſome well obſerve, is put by a participle of the preſent tenſe; <hi>Teach all Nations, Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> preſently upon their being taught, as all examples of that nature in the Acts of the Apoſtles do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. And if this were the very next thing in order to be done, after men were inſtructed to the beleef of the Goſpel, then an admiting them into Church fellowſhip without this, could not be without a deviation and turning from the rule of Chriſt in this behalf; which tranſgreſſion to ſuppoſe the Diſciples of Chriſt admiting, or the Diſciples admited, to be guilty of, is a peece of uncharitableneſs, more then I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to communicate in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles, according to the Commandement of Chriſt, begining firſt at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to put this Commiſſion of his into execution, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. did act accordingly. And doubtleſs their acting upon this Commiſſion, ought to be taken by us, as an interpretation of this Commiſſion, and their actions relating hereto, to be in purſuance of, and correſpondent to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118571:8"/> unleſs we will ſuppoſe them to ſtumble at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, and to begin to depart from it aſſoon as they began to act upon it; which would be too great an audaciouſnes in any man once to imagine. If ſo, then what is more plain, then that the Commiſſion of Chriſt to them, was to teach and baptiſe firſt, and to admit into Church fellowſhip thereupon, and not otherwiſe; as is viſible in that prime example of theirs, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.42. <hi>Then they that gladly received his Word, were Baptized, and the ſame day there was added unto them, about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls. And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in Prayers.</hi> Where you ſee, they were, firſt, taught by Preaching, ſecondly, did gladly receive the Word by which they were taught, thirdly were baptized, fourthly, were added unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 47. fifthly, continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellowſhip, &amp;c. Addition to the Church then, and fellowſhip in it, did follow baptiſm, and not go before it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the actuated commiſſion of Chriſt Jeſus. And why ſhould any ſervants of his, then, deſire to vary from it, unleſs they preſume themſelves wiſer then he, and hope to finde a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good in their own way, then in his?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Baptiſm muſt needs precede the enjoyment of Church priviledge, in Church fellowſhip, in the Apoſtles dayes, becauſe it was then, as it ought ſtill to be, a means of planting men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, or into the body of Chriſt the Church. Hence they were ſaid <hi>to be Baptized into Chriſt, Galathians</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>and to be baptized into his death, Romans</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>and to be planted together into the likeneſs of his death, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, ver.</hi> 5. <hi>of the ſame chapter.</hi> And what does a planting and a planting together import, but the firſt puting together of Chriſtians, in order to their growing together in Chriſt? and yet all this is done by Baptiſm. And may you not therefore, as well ſuppoſe trees to grow together, before they are planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as to ſuppoſe Chriſtians to grow together before they are planted together, and yet planted together they are by Baptiſm: not into this or that particular Church, but into that one Church of Chriſt, which is diſtributed into ſeverall parts and particular Societies. Hereupon it is, that Baptiſm is called
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118571:8"/> one of the <hi>Principles, or begining Doctrines of Chriſt,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe part of the Foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. And what houſe ſtands without its Principles, or is built without a foundation?</p>
                  <p>Nay the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. doth plainly declare Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to be of ſo conſtant and univerſall a uſe as to the inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of perſons of all ſorts, ranks, and degrees, that were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated at all in his time, as that none came into the Church, but through this door. For he ſayes, <hi>they were all Baptized into one body, (i. e.</hi> Church body) <hi>whether Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> or Gentils, bond or free.</hi> And if any man can name any perſons, that were neither Jews nor Gentiles, neither Bond nor Free, then I will confeſs, thoſe poſſibly might be brought into the Church without Baptiſm. But otherwiſe, though they were Jews, and had been formerly entred in their Church by circumciſion; yet when they became of the Goſpel Church, it was not without Baptiſm. Or if Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, a people ſometimes a far off, yet by Baptiſm upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, were brought into capacity of the ſame enjoyments with the Jews. If free, as Maſters, yet not admited without Baptiſm: if bound as ſervants, yet made equally capable of the ſame Church priviledges by Baptiſm: For ſo he ſayes again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27, 28. <hi>As many of you as have been Baptized into Christ, have put on Christ; there is neither Jew nor Gentle, bond, nor free, male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jeſus, i. e.</hi> all having thus put on Chriſt, are become all one in him.</p>
                  <p>Some indeed ſeem ſomewhat to doubt, whether the Apoſtle ſpeaks of water Baptiſm, when he ſayes, <hi>That by one Spirit we are all Baptiſed into one body;</hi> or whether he does not rather ſpeak of the Baptiſm of the Spirit without water.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe indeed are the doubtfull thoughs of ſome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the generally received opinion of men upon the place, yet I muſt do my honored Queriſt that right, as to quit him from fellowſhip in that opinion, and to acknowledge that he not long ſince in a diſcourſe upon the ſame words, did teach the Auditory to underſtand, by being Baptized by one Spirit into one Body, and by being made to drink into one Spirit, (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the latter part of the verſe) that the Communion which Beleevers have with the holy Spirit in the two Ordinances, Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord, is intended by the Apoſtle;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118571:9"/> and this he did, without doubt to me, according to the truth. For what elſe can be intended by drinking into one Spirit, but the Saints communion in Spirit in and by the Supper? drinking by a Synecdoche, being put both for eating and drinking. If ſo, why ſhould we not as wel underſtand the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neither can we reaſonably unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtand the ſame thing to be intended by being Baptiſed by one Spirit, and by drinking into one Spirit, (which yet we muſt do, if a being indued with the Spirit were all that is here meant,) for they are ſaid to be Baptized into one body, but to drink into one Spirit; and ſurely Baptizing and drinking here, are no more the ſame, then the Body and the Spirit are the ſame, into which they are ſaid reſpectively to be Baptized, and to drink. But cleerly the Apoſtle ſeems hereby to intend to minde theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> how that by means of the ſame ſpirit working upon all their hearts, they became members of the ſame body through Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and that being of the Body, they came to have communion in Spirit, or with the Spirit in the ſupper. And that which will yet further ſerve to evince, that it is not a Baptiſm with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but a Baptiſm with water that is here meant, is this, becauſe the ſpirit is here ſet forth by the Apoſtle as the Agent or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe, and Baptiſm as the effect; and it is ridiculous to make both cauſe and effect the ſame thing. It is true indeed, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſpeak of a being Baptized with the ſpirit; but when ever it does ſo, it ſtill declares either Jeſus Chriſt, or God the Father, as the Agent Baptizing with the ſpirit; but never as making the ſpirit both the ſubject matter wherewith, and alſo the Agent whereby men are Baptized in the ſame Baptiſm. See for this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4, 5. with <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.16.</p>
                  <p>The premiſes therefore conſidered, I hope it will ſufficiently appear and that to the ſatisfaction of any indifferent man, that in the primitive times, none were admited to Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion without Baptiſm; and if ſo, have we in theſe dayes reaſon to do any other wiſe?

                     <p>Not to take much notice how far the probable opinion of ſome will be accepted for proof againſt us, when nothing but demonſtrations will be accepted on our behalf, I ſhall firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Queriſt,</hi> that if the children and families of thoſe that gladly received the word, and were baptized, were indeed part of that number of 3000. that were added to the church; or to the Diſcſples, (as he ſayes it is the probable opinion of ſome that they were) then I demand, I ſay, whether theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and families were baptized or no? If he ſhall ſay they were not, then he puts to rebuke another of his opinions,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118571:14"/> which is, that when believers themſelves were baptized, their children were baptized alſo; to the belief of which he would perſwade us, at leaſt as probable, in his 24. Quaere from <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. If he ſay they were baptized, why then, though it ſhould be granted that theſe were ſome of the number, yet how would this prove, that others beſides thoſe that were baptized were added to the church, which yet is the thing he was to prove?</p>
                     <p>But then 2. to put the matter quite out of doubt, that none of the children of thoſe that gladly received the word, were part of the 3000. that were added to the church, (if by children, he mean little children, or infants; for els if they were <hi>adult</hi> ones, they might gladly receive the word, and be baptized as well as their parents) it ſufficiently appeares, in that it is ſaid, <hi>They</hi> (i. e. they that were added, as well as they to whom they were added) <hi>continued ſtedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> and I preſume the <hi>Queriſt</hi> will not ſay, that little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, infants, did continue ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread and prayers; and if not, then they were none of the number of the 3000. that were added to the church: and ſo I think by this time the probable opinion of ſome in this behalf, is rendred more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to be a weak, groundleſſe, and erroneous opinion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To remove that doubt touching the improbability, that 3000. men ſhould diſtinctly hear the voice of a man ſpeaking, unleſſe we will ſuppoſe them to ſtand neereſt to him that ſpake. 1. Evident it is, that they did hear, and ſo hear, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word gladly, but whether they were neereſt to him that ſpake or no, is more then he or I can tell, or need to know. But 2. There is no neceſſity to ſuppoſe that all the whole 3000. did all of them heare and convert in the ſelf-ſame hour or juncture of time; for one while the Apoſtle might preach to one company of them, and another while to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company, and yet this would not hinder, but that they might all be converted, baptized, and added to the church the ſelf-ſame day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Neither do I ſee any neceſſity to hold, that all theſe 3000.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118571:15"/> that were in one day converted, baptized, and added to the church, were thus converted and baptized by <hi>Peter</hi> only, but by him and the reſt of the Apoſtles, or by them and the other Diſciples alſo.

For who can imagine, but that if not all, yet that many of the 3000. that were baptized upon the preaching of <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt, had been baptized before by <hi>Iohn;</hi> or who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but that if not all, yet that many, at the leaſt, of that great multitude unto whom the Apoſtle preached at that time when the 3000. were converted, had beene baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> thoſe Scriptures conſidered, cited by the Queriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5.6. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.7.21. where it is ſaid, <hi>that all the Land of</hi> Judea, <hi>and they of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>were ALL baptized.</hi> And again, <hi>that ALL the people were baptized;</hi> and yet the Apoſtles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to theſe inhabitants of Jeruſalem, that were now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together to the number of many thouſands, was, that they <hi>would repent and be baptized EVERY ONE</hi> of them, and as many as did receive this word, were baptized accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and ſo added to the church.</p>
                     <p>Since then the owning of Chriſt crucified, together with a being baptized in his name, was requiſite to render men of the number of Diſciples, as a Church: Hence it came to paſſe, that <hi>Luke</hi> could not eſtimate their number to be more then 120. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.1.15. nor above about 5000. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4. notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more had been baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> unleſſe more of them had adhered to Chriſt crucified, as theſe did; ſo then, though bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm be one of the requiſites, not without which, yet it is not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118571:18"/> the only requiſite, by which the number of the church is to be eſtimated.

                  <p>But 2. It is but a meer conjecture (and as will be found, not only without ground, but againſt reaſon) that the Apoſtle in the forecited words, ſhould have reſpect unto ſuch a ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practiſe, as that ſpecified.</p>

                  <p>Theſe interpretations ſurely carry a far greater probability to anſwer the drift of the Apoſtle, then that given by the Quaeriſt: But ſurely there is little edification or ſatisfaction, when only one doubtfull thing is brought to prove another, or rather when one improbable thing muſt ſerve inſtead of a proof, to make that ſeem probable, which of it ſelf is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improbable: But is not that cauſe barren of proofes, and deſtitute of friends, that muſt be beholding to ſuch ſtrangers to ſtand by it, and ſuccour it?</p>

Though this be true, yet what is this to warrant a mans holding Communion with a company of believers, and acting with them as a Church, when he knowes they are no Church according to Goſpell-rule? It is not a company of Stones and pieces of Timber lying on a heap together that make a Houſe, till they are put in order, and into the forme of a building: nor can you properly and truly call that heap a Houſe, till the Foundation be firſt laid, and then the ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſet upon it. In like manner, neither are a company of Beleevers a Church, becauſe they are a company of Beleevers, nor can they duly act as ſuch, or be called or accounted ſuch in a Goſpell ſenſe, and according to order thereof, (which is the rule by which we muſt judge) till they are built together in an orderly way, the Foundation firſt (which in primitive Churches was never laid without Baptiſme) and the ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture after. <hi>Ye alſo as lively ſtones, are built (or be ye built) up

If not, as it is moſt certaine he cannot reaſonably ſo think: then give me leave to think, that they build without their rule, and not according to the method of the wiſe Maſter-Buliders of the firſt Churches, who both lay Foundation, and put on the Top-Stone too, without Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>For a man then to hold communion with a company of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not in Goſpell order, and to act with them as if they were, and yet to witneſſe againſt ſuch practice of theirs too, what is it elſe, then for a man to <hi>condemne himſelfe in that which he alloweth, Rom.</hi> 14.22. yea and to make <hi>himſelfe a tranſgreſſor in building what he deſtroyes?

               <p>To this Querie I ſhall ſay, That the Commiſſion of Chriſt to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118571:26"/> baptiſe upon their believing, all that by teaching were brought to believe, and the ſeries of examples in Scripture anſwering this Commiſſion, and other Scriptures importing all of the Church to be incorporated by Baptiſme, as in our anſwer to the firſt and third Queries is more particularly declared. This is ſufficient ground for us to conclude, that the converts at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> and <hi>Iconium, Acts</hi> 13.43. and 14.1. were baptized by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who converted them, before ſuch time they departed and left them; unleſſe you will ſuppoſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to neglect their duties towards thoſe converts, which if it could be proved they did, yet would be no ground for Believers now to neglect theirs.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould the Queriſt preſume any more of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> their holding Church-communion with theſe converts, then of their being baptiſed, the one being no more mentioned then the other? or why ſhould he ſuppoſe that they had more opportunity to put them into Church-order, and to joyn in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion thereupon, then to baptiſe them?</p>

               <p>This Querie being much of the ſame import with the tenth and fifteenth Queries, the ſame Anſwer will ſerve. For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt both in this and ſeverall other Queries, miſ-repreſents and miſtakes the caſe in queſtion: for the queſtion is not whether a Member of a Chriſtian Church may withdraw his communion becauſe of ſome defect or errour in the Church, (which yet is the thing queried, and I have elſewhere anſwered that he may not) but the queſtion, if rightly ſtated, would be, whether a company of Believers, though unbaptiſed, either are, or may become, whilſt ſuch, a true viſible Church according to Goſpel-order? or whether a man, who upon ſatisfactory grounds, doth verily deem them not ſo to be, may yet hold communion with them as if they were ſuch, untill he hath with long ſuffering endeavoured to convince them that they are no Church indeed according to Scripture-account? For otherwiſe, the Queriſt does but beg the queſtion, and then taking it as granted him, (which is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed) proceeds to render a ſeparation unreaſonable upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this or that failing in the Church, as indeed well he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118571:26"/> might, if that were true which he ſuppoſes, touching the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive being of the Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore the buſineſſe may be brought into a narrower compaſſe, then ſo many queries extend to as are imployed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. For let the Queriſt prove us from the Word of God (which is that which onely ought to ſway us in this matter) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. That a company of Believers without Baptiſme, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come truly, and according to Goſpel-order, a Church of Chriſt viſibly conſtituted, or elſe 2. That a man who knowes, or upon Scripture grounds does believe a company of men and women to be no Church, according to ſuch order, though Believers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they were <hi>baptiſed into Jeſus Christ,</hi> may notwithſtanding this his knowledge or perſwaſion, hold communion with them as if they were ſuch a Church, untill he hath convinced them that they are not: and then theſe things being proved, I ſuppoſe the conteſt will be ended.</p>
               <p>For had the Queriſt himſelfe been ſatisfied touching the due conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which he once profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe a Member, I ſuppoſe he would not have deemed the errours in it to have been a juſt ground of his ſeparation from it, ſince we read of very foule evills in ſome of the primitive Churches themſelves, but doe not finde the ſound party exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſeparate from the corrupt, but to proceed againſt them in a Church-way for their cure, by admonition, conviction, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in caſe of obſtinacy.</p>

               <p>To this I ſay, that whatever elſe a company of true Believers have done, yet if they have not done that which is neceſſary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture-account to render themſelves a true Church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Goſpel order, then it is not unreaſonable for a Chriſtian to deny them to be ſuch a Church. But yet for all that, it does not follow that ſuch a denyall renders them but as a rabble rout of the world; becauſe unbaptiſed Believers are a third thing,

               <p>Anſwer, 1. If by Chriſtians, the Queriſt meanes no more then true Believers in Chriſt Jeſus, then I know none that ſo magnifie the Ceremony or externall Rite of Baptiſme, as to judge none Chriſtians without it; nay the truth is, it is becauſe we judge the Queriſt and others true Believers, that we do perſwade them to be baptiſed.</p>
               <p>But if by Chriſtians he meanes ſuch as according to the Word have put on Chriſt, then we muſt ſay, that thoſe that by being baptiſed into Chriſt, have not put on Chriſt, are not yet ſuch Chriſtians as they ought to be. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27.

               <p>That which will be very well worth our noting here in the firſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118571:28"/> place, is, how the truth which we plead hath gained a faire and ample acknowledgement, even from the Queriſt himſelfe in this Querie, though he oppoſe it in others. For he does not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether there be any precept or example in Scripture for the baptiſing of any perſon after many yeares profeſſion of the Goſpell; but alſo, whether there be any precept or example in Scripture for the baptiſing of any perſon, <hi>at any other time,</hi> SAVE AT, OR ABOUT <hi>their firſt entrance upon a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt?</hi> And not onely ſo neither, but farther demands, Whether <hi>there be any competent ground, either in Reaſon or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why either ſuch a thing ſhould have beene practiſed by Chriſtians in the Apoſtles dayes, or why it ought to be practiſed by any in theſe dayes?</hi> By which I am ſure he ſayes as much to the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Infant-Baptiſme, as lightly can be ſpoken in ſo few words; and in ſubſtance as much as ever any man did ſay in oppoſition to that practiſe.</p>
               <p>For if there be neither precept nor example in Scripture, for the baptiſing of any perſon, <hi>at any other time</hi> SAVE <hi>at or about the time of their firſt entrance upon the profeſſion of Chriſt;</hi> nor yet <hi>competent ground in Reaſon or Religion,</hi> why it ſhould otherwiſe be practiſed: then certainly there is neither precept or example in Scripture for the baptiſing of Infants, nor yet any competent ground why ſuch a thing ſhould be practiſed; and the reaſon is, becauſe Infants in their infancy can make no profeſſion of Chriſt, nor doe they in their infancy make any entrance upon a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neither let any man think that I wrong the Queriſt in wreſting his words contrary to his intention: For though I believe that which I infer from them, was no part of his intention, yet I doe not wreſt his words, but onely infer from them that which muſt be true, if that which he layes downe querie-wiſe for a truth, be a truth. And it is a thing not unuſuall for perſons who plead the cauſe of any errour in Religion, at one turne or other, to utter that which cuts the throat of their own tenent.</p>
               <p>But now to anſwer to that which the Queriſt intends indeed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there be no example in Scripture of any mans being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, after many yeares profeſſion of the Goſpell, it is becauſe there is no example in Scripture of any ſuch ſinfull negligence in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118571:28"/> Believers, as to continue many yeares in the profeſſion of the Goſpell without being baptiſed: if there were any lingering and delaying in this caſe, they were awakened to their duty, as many Believers have now need to be: <hi>And now, why tarryeſt thou? Ariſe and be baptiſed, Acts</hi> 22.16. If then Believers in theſe dayes have been more remiſſe and negligent in yeilding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt in this command of his, then Believers were in the Apoſtles dayes, well may it ſerve to humble and to ſhame them, but by no meanes to encourage them to perſevere in that neglect.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Cornelius</hi> had beene a long time a fearer of God, and it is probable had knowledge of <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſing, or of <hi>Chriſts</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing long before, in as much as he was famouſly knowne among the Jewes; for he is ſaid to <hi>have a good report among all the nation of the Jewes, Acts</hi> 10.22. and therefore it is not unlike, but he might as well know what was done among the Jewes, as they know what was done by him: beſides, <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking to him, and thoſe with him, ſaith, <hi>That word (I ſay) you know which was publiſhed throughout all</hi> Judea, <hi>and began from</hi> Galilee, <hi>after the Baptiſme which</hi> John <hi>preached, &amp;c.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118571:30"/> Nor is the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, like to be ſo taking with others that are but Spectators, either as to the informing of their judgements, or moving of their affections, when applied to a Creature (as an Infant is,) expreſſing no knowledge of God, or <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor Love or Obedience to him, or any deſire to his wayes, as the ſame would be, when adminiſtred to a Believer, who by his voluntary ſubmiſſion to that Ordinance, Preaches to men his beliefe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Dead, Buried, and Riſen againe; And his exepectation of Remiſſion of ſins through Faith in his Name, and their own deſires, and reſolutions, of giving up themſelves wholly unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> unleſſe you will ſuppoſe, there is no difference betweene zeale and no zeale in this behalfe, which cannot be ſuppoſed without contradicting the Spirit of thoſe and the like Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. with <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29, 30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I cannot be of the Queriſts minde (I confeſſe) <hi>that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and Baptiſme are the ſame in Spirit and Subſtance, though differing in the Letter;</hi> Becauſe circumciſion was no ſigne or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the Death, Buriall, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and of Mens Death, Buriall, and Reſurrection with him, which yet the Scripture makes to be the ſpirit of Baptiſme, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. And therefore this reaſon, is no reaſon, either why Baptiſme ſhould rather appropriately belong to Infants, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any others, or indeed that it ſhould belong to them or all, though Circumciſion did.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>I ſuppoſe the Queriſt would have us to conceive from theſe Scriptures, that Circumciſion was a Seale of the Righteouſneſſe which comes by Faith, and Baptiſme a Seale of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wich comes by Repentance, and therefore the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually. But what relation ſoever Baptiſme hath to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (as indeed I no where finde it called a Seale of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118571:30"/> of Repentance) yet confident I am, that when the Apoſtle calls Circumciſion, <hi>A Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of that Faith which</hi> Abraham <hi>had before he was circumciſed,</hi> hee does not deſcribe the common nature of Circumciſion, as he had done in thoſe words imediately before, where he calls it a Signe, which agrees with Gods own Denomination of it when he firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and therefore moſt likely adequately to anſwer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end and uſe of it; But hee deſcribes Circumciſion in theſe words, <hi>A Seale of the Righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> as that which it was peculiarly to <hi>Abraham.</hi> For 1. It is not called a Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of Faith indefinitely, but onely <hi>A Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of the Faith which HE HAD.</hi> And 2. <hi>A Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of the Faith which he had, being yet uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> And then 3. The end wherefore Circumciſion became ſuch a Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, and it was this, <hi>THAT hee might be the Father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And were not theſe things, in reſpect whereof Circumciſion was a Seale, peculiar unto <hi>Abraham</hi> onely? Or did God ever give Circumciſion (as is ſaid, <hi>he gave to</hi> Abraham <hi>the Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> Acts 7.8.) to any other as the Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of the Faith which he had before he was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, or to ratifie and eſtabliſh him the Father of all that ſhould afterward believe? If not, why ſhould we thinke Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was in common a Seale of the Righteouſneſſe of Faith to other men, as long as the reaſons wherefore it is ſo called, are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar unto <hi>Abraham</hi> alone?</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles ſcope here, was, (as will appeare in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text) to prove that Circumciſion did contribute nothing in the buſineſſe of juſtification: and this hee proves, in that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified before Circumciſed; and not onely ſo, but his very receiving of Circumciſion from God upon theſe tearmes hee did receive it, was an evidence or demonſtration, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified in the ſight of God before hee received it, and that he did receive it for ſuch an end, as that he might ſtand declared under this Seale of God, as a Man of ſuch high acceptation with God, as to be thereupon called and accounted the Father, the famous example and patterne of all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118571:31"/> thoſe that ſhould believe. And if <hi>Abraham</hi> did receive Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, as a Teſtimoniall of that love which God did beare to him before, (as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſayes, that God <hi>found his heart faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before him, and entered into Covenant with him</hi> thereupon, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.8.) then it could not be the procuring cauſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> acceptation with God. This conſtruction of the word then, ſo directly anſwering and accommodating the drift and Scope of the Apoſtle, I ſee no reaſon to embrace any other that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it.</p>

                  <hi>ſufficiently</hi> appeare. 1. Becauſe the houſholds whoſe being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is recorded, being onely but three, it may with as good probability be affirmed, that there were no little Children in them, as that there were, and in that reſpect we are upon equall ground with our friends, in denying, what they take liberty only to ſuppoſe. 2. If there were Infants in thoſe houſholds, yet the word Houſe, or Houſhold, in Scripture frequently imports, not all and every individuall Soule in the houſe, but either the major part, or ſo many of the houſe, which according to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are to be ſuppoſed capable of thoſe affirmations that are made concerning them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.4. &amp; 35.2. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.3.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.13. &amp; 12.35. <hi>John</hi> 4.53. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. &amp; 10.2 <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.10, 11. And accordingly muſt thoſe Scriptures be underſtood where houſholds are ſaid to be Baptized. 3. In that it is ſaid concerning one of the three houſholds whoſe Baptiſme is recorded, <hi>That the Word of the Lord was ſpoken to them, and that they believed, Acts</hi> 16.34. and of another, <hi>that they addicted themſelves to the Miniſtery of the Saints,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 16. It is evident, that either there were no Infants in thoſe houſholds, or elſe that when they ſpeake of houſholds, they meane onely ſuch of them, as had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the age of ſo much underſtanding, as to doe, heare, and believe ſuch things, as were incompetible to the capacity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants or little Children.</p>
               <p>To the reaſons moving the Queriſt to thinke Infants were Baptized, when theſe houſholds were Baptized, I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God hath not left the Precept, and perpetuall example of Circumciſing Infants as a pit uncovered, (for Believers to fall into by Baptizing their Children) by giving no hint of the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his minde in that behalfe:</hi> For in that hee hath in the New Teſtament, aboliſhed the uſe and practice of Circumciſing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, its cleare hee hath aboliſhed the Law by which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Infants was enjoyned. But hee hath done the former, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. Therefore the latter. And therefore conſidering that the Law of Circumciſion, as all other <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Rites, being diſanulled, I cannot but wonder, that any man ſhould build any thing upon it for the Baptizing of Infants: Is not a repealed Law, and no Law, of the ſame
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118571:32"/> conſideration, as to its being any ground of practice?</p>
               <p>But may wee not much rather conceive, that ſince God did make a Law againſt mans <hi>opening, or digging a pit in his field, and not covering it,</hi> to prevent the miſcarriage of Man or Beaſt, in falling into it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.33. that then ſurely, he himſelfe would never have left <hi>the Precept, and perpetuall example</hi> of Baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. That which the Queriſt offers to render children to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in Scripture-ſence, is inſufficient as to the entitling of them to Baptiſm, or to cauſe us rationally to conceive them included in their number, who in the houſholds aforeſaid, are ſaid to have beleeved. For 1. If it ſhould be granted that children may be called Beleevers, not becauſe they doe beleeve indeed, but becauſe they are in like ſtate and condition with Beleevers, in reſpect of the love and favour of God, and their Title to the Kingdome of Heaven, which yet is all the Queriſt argues from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. Yet what is this to the proving of them actuall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, or ſuch as imbraced the Goſpell, or were made to beleeve by teaching? which yet were that kinde of Beleevers onely, unto whom Baptiſme was, or was to be adminiſtred, for ſo much as appeares throughout the whole New Teſtament. But 2. The truth is, the <hi>little ones</hi> which are ſaid to beleeve in <hi>Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 18.6. cannot with any congruity of reaſon be ſuppoſed to be any ſuch <hi>little ones,</hi> as Infants are: Becauſe they are deſcribed by an Act which preſuppoſeth, not only the Faculty, but the Uſe, Act and Exerciſe of the underſtanding; for ſo the Act of beleeving in <hi>Chriſt</hi> does, by which they are deſcribed, which yet as all men know, is incompetible to Infants. And therefore we muſt ſuppoſe, either 1. That the <hi>Child which Jeſus called to him, Ver.</hi> 2. was of ſo much underſtanding as rendred him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of beleeving, (and it was ſuch a Child as came upon the call of <hi>Jeſus:</hi>) or elſe 2. <hi>That the little ones,</hi> ver. 6. which are ſaid to <hi>believe,</hi> are not the ſame with that little Child mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And there are theſe two reaſons why they ſhould not

If we compare this paſſage with the other Evangeliſts, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.2.

But that repentance was the qualifying term of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, as Circumciſion was viſibly the qualifying term of Gods Covenant, appeares both by <hi>Johns</hi> Preaching, and the peoples receiving of Baptiſme: By <hi>Johns</hi> preaching; for its ſaid that he <hi>Preached the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118571:39"/> Baptiſme of Repentance,</hi> Luke 3.3. Acts 13.24. Now what was it for him to preach the Baptiſme of Repentance, but to preach that men ought to repent, and ſo to be Baptized? Which that it was, alſo appears in that thoſe that did receive Baptiſme from him according to his preaching, did profeſſe Repentance; for its ſaid, <hi>they were Baptized of</hi> John <hi>in</hi> Jordan, <hi>confeſſing their ſins,</hi> Mat. 3.6. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.5. But the Phariſees <hi>who trusted in themſelves that they were righteous,</hi> and <hi>Juſtified themſelves</hi> Luke 16.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.9 11. though many of them came to <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. yet it ſeems, diſowning the terms on which it was to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, <hi>viz.</hi> repentance for remiſſion of ſinnes, they are ſaid to have <hi>rejected</hi> (or made fruſtrate, as the word is) <hi>the Counſell of God againſt themſelves, not being Baptized of him.</hi> Luk 7.30.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the right underſtanding of the carriage of things here about in the very beginning of this Miniſtration of Baptiſm, is of great uſe by which to judge how it ought to be uſed now, the Miniſtration remayning ſtill, though the firſt Miniſtrators are dead, Therefore I ſhall deſire theſe two things may be well minded.</p>

For whereas <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in the places before mentioned, report the men that did eate of the five Loaves and two fiſhes, to be about five thouſand men; <hi>Mathew</hi> hee reports the perſons eating hereof to be about five thouſand men, <hi>beſides Women and Children.</hi> So that <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>John</hi> take notice onely of the number of the men in their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Miracle, whereas <hi>Mathew</hi> though he does exactly agree with them as touching the ſame number of men, yet he intimates that there were Women and Children that did eate, beſides the five thouſand men.

               <p>Something indeed hee alledges as a reaſon ſuch as it is, why

               <p n="1">1.

For there is no doubt but that for him to cauſe Baptiſme to be adminiſted to men when they did believe, was a conſiderable end of the Apoſtles ſending, as well as his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpell that men might beleeve, and therefore they are joyned in the Commiſſion thus: <hi>goe yee therefore teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> When therefore he ſayes, <hi>Chriſt ſent him not to Baptize,</hi> doubtleſſe hee means, that the injunction did not lie upon him ſo much to adminiſter Baptiſme with his owne hands (for that is the thing of which hee was ſpeaking) as to Preach the Goſpell, becauſe that being a worke that might be done by an ordinary Diſciple, hee was not otherwiſe obliged in that caſe but to take care that it ſhould be done, if not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet by ſome other, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. <hi>Peter commanded them to be Baptized in the Name of the Lord:</hi> poſſibly by ſuch aſſiſtants as the Apoſtles were wont to take with them, and not unlike for that very purpoſe as well as for other cauſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.5. &amp; 15.38. Juſt as it was in the caſe of Miniſtering to the poore; it lay upon the Apoſtles, as the care of all the Churches did, to take

               <p>And that which is yet more conſiderable, is, that if it ſhould appeare by unqueſtionable Hiſtory (which for ought I could ever learne does not, but the contrary) that the baptiſing of Children had been practiſed in the next age after the Apoſtles, yet unleſſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118571:45"/> it could be made appeare that it was practiſed by approbation of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtles times, or that by ſome injunction it ought ſo to have been, it would not at all be any ground to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſuch a practiſe now, becauſe as the <hi>myſtery of iniquity did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to work</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes, ſo there was a departing in part from the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of the inventions of men, whileſt it was yet but early. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>that after my departing, ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flocke, alſo of your owne ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them,</hi> Act. 20.29, 30.</p>
               <p>But 2. If the Queriſt thinks Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> is worthy of credit in his foreſaid report, though he produce no Authors, may not the Authors of a Book, entituled <hi>A very plaine and well grounded Treatiſe concerning Baptiſme,</hi> be rather credited in their allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Authors that aſſert the contrary to Mr. <hi>Philpot?</hi> Amongſt very many Authors which they produce on this account, I ſhall inſtance in ſome few.</p>
               <p>In pag. 19. of the ſaid Book thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian in Libro de Baptiſmo:</hi> That Infants or young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould not be ſo ſpeedily baptiſed: and upon the ſaying of the Lord; <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me and forbid them not:</hi> he ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Let them come when they are growne, and are able to be inſtructed:</hi> when they can learne to know Chriſt, then may they be Chriſtians.
